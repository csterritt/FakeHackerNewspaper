h2. Overview

So this is my code... it's a bit of a hack :-) but it has a few rspec specs in the
specs directory.

Run:

% rspec specs/*

to run them all... they should all pass.

To get actual useful work done, run:

% ruby parse_hn_front_page.rb > results.txt

This shows a dump of what it finds, and what the objects contain.

h2. Future Work

Obviously, a lot could be done.  I think it would be useful to set up classes
that recognize popular sites (nytimes.com, wsj.com, etc.) that don't easily give
up their useful text.
